## Usage

### Main screen
On the mainscreen you can see three bookshelves that contain the books you are currently reading, want to read or have read.
Using the green arrow button displayed on the book cover you can move a book to a different shelf. If you choose 'none', the book will be removed
from your shelves.

### Search screen
Using the plus button in the lower right corner, you can go to the search screen.
Using the search bar you can search for books. From the search results you can choose
to add the book to a shelf using the green arrow button in the same manner you can add a book to a shelf on the
home screen.
